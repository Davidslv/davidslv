## Hi there 👋

I'm a Software Engineer based in London, passionate about software design, architecture, scalable systems, microservices, and event-driven setups.

I'm a strong advocate for the underrated Extreme Programming, which boosts code quality, responsiveness, and collaboration through practices like pair programming, TDD, and continuous integration.

I enjoy reading books such as:
- *Modern Software Engineering* by David Farley
- *Designing Data-Intensive Applications* by Martin Kleppmann
- *Generative Design* (for creating art with code)
- *Software Architecture: The Hard Parts*

For fun, I'm crafting [Vanilla Roguelike](https://github.com/Davidslv/vanilla-roguelike), a pure-Ruby roguelike inspired by the 1980s classic [Rogue](https://github.com/Davidslv/rogue). It features procedural maze generation, ECS architecture, and event-driven systems for a terminal-based adventure. 

I'm author of the book 📕 [Building Your Own Roguelike: A Practical Guide](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0G1RBWF6V).

## Pokémon Pokédex (Gen 1 Edition)

### Project Overview

For my young nephew, an avid Pokémon fan, I built a kid-friendly digital Pokédex inspired by the original Generation 1 games (featuring all 151 classic Pokémon from Bulbasaur to Mew). This web app serves as a fun, interactive encyclopedia to help him explore and learn about his favorite pocket monsters—complete with vibrant artwork, key stats, and trivia—without the overwhelm of the full official Pokédex. It's an "approximate" version, meaning it's a simplified, custom take focused on essential details to spark joy and curiosity during playtime.

This project was a labor of love, blending my passion for web development with family bonding. It taught me the power of user-centered design by thinking what would excite a 7-year-old.

**Key Features**

- **Voice Narration**: Leverages Web Speech Synthesis functions to read aloud Pokémon names, stats, and trivia for an immersive, hands-free experience.
- **Kid-Safe Design**: Clean, colorful UI with large buttons, no ads.

**Tech Stack**

Vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for a lightweight, performant interface without frameworks, including Web Speech API for dynamic audio features.
