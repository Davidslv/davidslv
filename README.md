## Hi there 👋

I'm a Software Engineer based in London, passionate about software design, architecture, scalable systems, microservices, and event-driven setups.

I'm a strong advocate for the underrated Extreme Programming, which boosts code quality, responsiveness, and collaboration through practices like pair programming, TDD, and continuous integration.

I enjoy reading books such as:
- *Modern Software Engineering* by David Farley
- *Designing Data-Intensive Applications* by Martin Kleppmann
- *Generative Design* (for creating art with code)
- *Software Architecture: The Hard Parts*

For fun, I'm crafting [Vanilla Roguelike](https://github.com/Davidslv/vanilla-roguelike), a pure-Ruby roguelike inspired by the 1980s classic [Rogue](https://github.com/Davidslv/rogue). It features procedural maze generation, ECS architecture, and event-driven systems for a terminal-based adventure.
